            Thomas O'Connor</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my CS879 Final Project page. This is a small webapp built on Flask which will be used to simulate:<br>
               Encryption/Decryption/Evesdropping in RSA and El Gamal. In addtion there are various helper functions <br>
               (Fast Modular Exponentiation, Miller-Rabin Primality Test, PseudoRandom Prime Genereator, etc) that can be used and tested
            </p>

            <p>When you are performing the ElGamal and RSA simulations please write down your keys and any encrypted/decrypted messages<br>
            the web app <b>will not</b>keep a record of what you have slected once you refresh the page</p><br>
            <p>
                In the El Gamal section you will notcice forms for encrypting/decrypting stings. They work but not as well as the algorithms for encrypting/decryping numbers
                my group decied to only encrypt/decrypt numbers for our exchanges so those algorithms are much more tests.
            </p>
